## About Me

I'm a veteran of JavaScript application development. I've worked with major brands you've heard of such as Adobe (Computer Scientist, Creative Cloud team) and Zumba Fitness (head of client-side architecture). At various times, I've been tasked with hiring and interviewing JavaScript developers to build applications with millions of users. That is harder than it sounds.

*99 out of 100 candidates I've interviewed don't have the qualifications to hit the ground running.*

To fix that, I wrote a book called ["Programming JavaScript Applications" (O'Reilly)](http://learn-javascript.ericelliott.me/programming-javascript-applications/). It's finished and shipping, and it's already helping a great deal... but it's not approachable for novice JavaScript developers-in-training.

What we need is a solution that can guide programmers of any skill level from the first steps to completion of a world-class JavaScript application, front-to-back. That's where these courses come in.


## About the Courses

["Learn JavaScript with Eric Elliott"](http://learn-javascript.ericelliott.me/programming-javascript-applications/) engages students on many levels:

* **Audio / video:** 7-10 minute video instruction
* **Hands-on practice:** Online Workbook text to introduce concepts and interactive, self-grading exercises
* **Textbook** "Programming JavaScript Applications" is included with all course bundles. You'll find references in the video and practice exercises referring you to deeper study in the book.
* **Collaboration** Create an agile study group to share encouragement and tutoring as you progress.


## Supporting a Good Cause

We launched ["Learn JavaScript with Eric Elliott" on Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ericelliott/learn-javascript) and raised 250% of our goal. The campaign went viral after I posted a story on medium: ["Fighting Poverty with Code"](https://medium.com/the-backer-army/fighting-poverty-with-code-d1ed3ebd982d). We're on a mission to end homelessness. There is a global movement to end homelessness by providing the homeless with free housing. It turns out, housing the homeless is less expensive than letting them live on the street, and once they're in a stable home environment, they are much more likely to escape the grip of poverty and become productive, self-reliant citizens. That's where you come in: Your support allows us to help housing-first programs implement effective job-training programs for the homeless. We're teaching the homeless how to code, and helping them into rewarding careers.

If you'd like to do even more, you can [follow @TheBackerArmy on twitter](https://twitter.com/thebackerarmy) and help spread the word. We are building a network of volunteers that spans coast-to-coast in the United States, and includes several other countries around the globe.



*Together we can change the world.*
