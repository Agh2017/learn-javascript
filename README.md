## Status

**We release content on a regular basis, and there is a lot of training available right now.** For details on materials that are currently available, [check out the shop page](https://ericelliottjs.com/shop/).

We believe in **frequent updates** instead of hard deadlines. This allows for the flexibility of real life. For example, it allowed us to react to the ES6 & React takeover that happened in 2015. ES6 took over a lot faster than anybody predicted it would. At the same time, React took off like a rocket ship. Providing a constant stream of new lessons and training rather than a rigid plan with hard dates allows us to stay nimble and deliver training material that's relevant to you today.

**We also believe in providing constant, ongoing value to our customers.** As I type this, in the past week and a half, we've created 5 new videos, including the first 3 episodes of [the new Shotgun video series](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/shotgun-javascript-video-experience-c8b6a7771d49), a screencast that lets you ride shotgun while I build real apps, explaining and teaching every step of the way.

We also released a free sample lesson you can watch right now: ["What is a Pure Function?"](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/master-the-javascript-interview-what-is-a-pure-function-d1c076bec976)

## Don't Learn JavaScript - Learn How to Build Amazing Things

It's easy to find people with JavaScript experience. It's extremely hard to find JavaScript developers who really understand the craft of building great applications.

*99 out of 100 candidates I've interviewed lack the qualifications to hit the ground running.* The fact is, [JavaScript Training Sucks](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/javascript-training-sucks-284b53666245). That's the problem we're solving with these courses.

To fix that, I wrote a book called [“Programming JavaScript Applications”](http://pjabook.com) (O’Reilly). It's finished and shipping, and it's already helping a great deal... but it's not approachable for novice JavaScript developers-in-training.

What we need is a solution that can guide programmers of any skill level from the first steps to completion of a world-class JavaScript application, front-to-back. That's where these courses come in.

### JavaScript Software Testing with Sauce Labs

***The only thing that matters in development is that users love the product.***

This course is **a step-by-step guide to building a product that users will love.** These lessons are hard won over a long career, and borrow heavily from many other software development teams who have contributed to the emergence of **lean startup culture** that has transformed Silicon Valley, and **transformed the way large enterprise organizations produce great products, too.**.

I have worked at **organizations that failed to test products well.** The common result is that *products took weeks, months, or years to ship software and updates.* I consulted for one firm that shipped a new release about once every two years, and even with all that time to prepare, **integrating code** from several teams into one product without breaking the build **was a nightmare.**

Every time we would try to get the build ready somebody would submit a bug fix or a new feature that conflicted with code that somebody else had changed. We had dedicated release engineers on the case to help resolve conflicts and get the build passing QA again. **Broken processes made us miss target date after target date.** I wanted to do something about it, but the root of the problem ran deep, from inward thinking product management to deeply ingrained developer habits. Every process change we managed to implement was a hard battle against the dysfunctional corporate culture.

A few years later, I worked at another company &mdash; **a five year old startup** at the time that had taken a whole industry by storm and become a global leader. We were growing the business at a very fast clip, hiring as fast as we could get qualified candidates in the door &mdash; but we had missed several release date targets already, and **we struggled to implement new processes while we were trying to onboard new recruits.**

By way of contrast, I have also worked with **large enterprise organizations who have taken lessons from the lean startup movement** and somehow managed to escape the old corporate culture and embrace working in small, agile teams with tools automating the process of testing and product integration.

**We shipped code to production on a daily basis,** and even at a big company with tens of thousands of employees, we were nimble enough to respond quickly to customer needs, ship bug fixes quickly, and integrate important new features dreamed up by the product teams.

Good agile teams are effective because they know how to fail fast on a strict budget, and learn lessons quickly. From the customer's perspective they appear responsive to the costomer's needs. A high quality testing process is the cornerstone of good agile developement.

In this course, you'll be guided through a product development process that works -- one that I've adapted from my experiences working with companies of all kinds, from tiny startups to market leading enterprise businesses. I've taken the best ideas from each, and distilled that hard won wisdom into ten minute video chunks interspersed with text, exercises, and real-world examples. The course is specifically targeted to JavaScript developers, so all the examples and exercises will be relevant to the things you want to learn how to do.

The value of these lessons can't be overstated. The ideas, tools, and techniques in this course will inform your career and help you make confident, data-driven decisions with a real potential to make a strong impact on the bottom line. There is nothing else like this on the market at any price.


## Supporting a Good Cause

We're on a mission to end homelessness. There is a global movement to end homelessness by providing the homeless with free housing. Intake tracking studies show that housing the homeless is less expensive than letting them live on the street. Once they're in a stable home environment, they are much more likely to escape the grip of poverty and become productive, self-reliant citizens. That's where you come in: Your support allows us to help housing-first programs implement effective job-training programs for the homeless. We're teaching the homeless how to code, and helping them into rewarding careers.

*Together we can change the world.*
