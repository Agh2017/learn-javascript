Status: Learn JavaScript with Eric Elliott 
==========================================

**We release content on a regular basis, and there is a lot of training available right now.** For details on materials that are currently available, [check out the shop page](https://ericelliottjs.com/shop/).

We believe in **frequent updates** instead of hard deadlines. This allows for the flexibility of real life. For example, it allowed us to react to the ES6 & React takeover that happened in 2015. ES6 took over a lot faster than anybody predicted it would. At the same time, React took off like a rocket ship. Providing a constant stream of new lessons and training rather than a rigid plan with hard dates allows us to stay nimble and deliver training material that's relevant to you today.

**We also believe in providing constant, ongoing value to our customers.** As I type this, in the past week and a half, we've created 5 new videos, including the first 3 episodes of [the new Shotgun video series](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/shotgun-javascript-video-experience-c8b6a7771d49), a screencast that lets you ride shotgun while I build real apps, explaining and teaching every step of the way.

We also released a free sample lesson you can watch right now: ["What is a Pure Function?"](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/master-the-javascript-interview-what-is-a-pure-function-d1c076bec976)
