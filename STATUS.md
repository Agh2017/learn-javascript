## The Game Plan

1. **July 2014:** Plan course outlines and raise $7.5k to pay for the course production costs. This covers the costs of course materials, video recording, editing, and graphic design. Thanks to your help, we raised $25,000 and expanded our goal to create two additional courses.
2. **Early 2015:** Launch the first course, and begin JSHomes.org website and raise awareness. This is where we are today. Our first course is nearing completion and we’re gearing up to launch it. In the meantime, we’re raising funds to help with the JSHomes outreach effort, and to create an online platform that works better for our course materials than currently available e-learning platforms.
3. **Mid-2015:** Multiple course deployments & .org accounts. We plan to deploy more courses and expand website capabilities so that organizations can subscribe. This is when we’ll launch the pilot job training program to serve the homeless communities.
4. **Late 2015:** First four courses launched. Track progress of housing-first training programs.
