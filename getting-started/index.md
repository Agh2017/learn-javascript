# Getting Started With the Terminal, Git, and Node

Most JavaScript developers make heavy use of the bash terminal, git, and Node. Chances are, you won't get far on your JavaScript journey without them.

Node will be used for both server-side and client-side programming in JavaScript, and npm, which comes with Node, is the standard package manager for Node, meaning that it's how you'll access all the open source libraries available for use in your projects.

Git keeps track of changes to source code over time, and helps you share those changes and collaborate with other developers. As I write this, GitHub is the website most JavaScript developers use to coordinate work on Git repositories using the integrated issue tracker, and peer code reviews with pull requests.

The bash terminal is the standard way for interacting with both Node and the command-line Git tools. The following are a few resources you might find useful while you're starting to learn these tools.

## Installing Node

If you want to install Node, there are two ways I recommend:

* For OS X and Linux, [use nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)
* For Windows, use [the official installer](https://nodejs.org/)

For OS X and Linux, nvm solves permissions issues that you'd normally encounter with the default installer, and it also allows you to easily manage multiple versions of Node, so you can test your code using different versions of the Node engine. Very handy!
